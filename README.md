# propertyPredictor
App that will predict the likely hood that a property will appreciate in the short to mid term


tech used:
node.js
react library
flux framework
ajax 


My process:
I knew a few things before the project:
1. That I wanted to make a react/flux app
2. That I wanted to call and API 
3. And I wanted it to be very simple.
